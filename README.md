Buttons Game created by Girish Verma

Created using Flutter and its packages.

Buttons is an exciting multilevel game which brings a unique 'Game of Luck' right at your fingertips. Having two play modes, it becomes even more fun, test your luck against a friend in 2 Player mode OR challenge your destiny in Challenge mode and get to the last level, if you can ! 

2 Player Mode
= Challenge your friend and/or family to a duel of luck! Set a winning score and win with your luck, simply press any button on screen and let your luck decide your point.

Challenge Mode
= Challenge Mode tests your luck like no other game. Press the button on the screen and see how lucky you are, move on to the next level with your luck but beware, the higher the level the harder the fall ! (  back to level 1 )
